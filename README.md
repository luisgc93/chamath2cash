A stock trading [twitter bot](https://twitter.com/Chamath2Cash) powered by tweets from billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya.

The bot currently runs a job every 2 minutes to parse any new tweets from @chamath. If those tweets contain a cash tag, it parses the stock tickers and places an order using an [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/) paper trading account and also publishes its current portfolio value.
